== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to wrap shortcode parameters to doublequotes or singlequotes? =

No. I even suggest to you avoid wrapping shortcode parameters to double/single quotes to prevent broken output when some plugins modify content with nasty filters.

Just avoid empty space between ID's.

= Is there any way to make the pop up player any bigger? =

You can use custom style with following selector and a rule:

`.ytc-mfp-container.ytc-mfp-iframe-holder .ytc-mfp-content {
  max-width: 1200px;
}`

Just set preferred popup max width in pixels.
